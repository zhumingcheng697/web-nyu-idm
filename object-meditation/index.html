        <p>A train is the line I took when I first came to NYC on our move-in day August last year. I got on an A train at Howard Beach–JFK carrying my two suitcases and rided for about an hour until I finally arrived at Jay St–MetroTech. Because the train I took was one of the older models that doesn’t automatically announce the stop, and I wasn’t familiar with all the names of the stations (and I’m still not), I had to keep checking the map on my phone to make sure I haven’t missed my stop. I also got out of the station from the wrong exit that day and it took me quite some time to realize that I had been walking in the wrong direction.</p>

        <p>I only took D train once late October last year when I went somewhere aroung 62nd St in southern Brooklyn to apply for a UK visa. The neighborhood over there looked quite rural and there really weren’t any one on the street. It was hard to imagine that it was still a part of NYC instead of some random no-name town at the countryside. I was glad that the visa interview didn’t take too long and I got back to my dorm before sunset. Otherwise I probably would have been quite worried about my safety in that neighborhood.</p>

        <p>I usually don’t take F train very often unless I go to Chinatown, where F train is the only convenient route. I did, however, have a memorable experience when I took F train to uptown Manhattan on September 20th last year. I got up at around six to seven that day and got off at 57th St for the grand reopen of the iconic Apple Store on 5th Avenue. Hundreds, if not thousands of enthusiastic fans had already been waiting there when I arrived and I sadly didn’t get the chance to take a selfie with Tim Cook (yeah the first dozens of people who got there actually had that privilege). Nonetheless, I got a souvenir bag and took a picture of Tim Cook waving us goodbye like 100ft away.</p>

      <div class="words">
        <p>I think I only took G train a couple of times as well. Once there was an exhibition at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City and our professor asked us to visit there if we had time that weekend. It took me almost an hour waiting for the train at Hoyt St and getting over there. Lots of people were at the exhibition on that sunny day and there was a gigantic tent with at least three to five hundred people squeezed inside. I didn’t feel like staying at a place with so many people for too long and I took some awkward selfies as our professor had requested and left the exhibition in about half an hour.</p>

      <div class="words">
        <p>I have always had some mixed feelings about R train. On one hand, it’s very convenient taking R train to the Washington Square campus and getting off at 8th St–NYU, but on the other hand, it’s unreasonably slow comparing to A train or even C train and F train. Once I wanted to stop by at the Lady M on 28th St before going to Penn Station for my train (like actual Amtrak train) and I left at least forty minutes early, but I ended up sprinting from 28th St directly to 34th St and I had to run down the escalator in the opposite direction at Penn Station as the gate was supposedly already closed. If I got there literally a minute late I probably wouldn’t have been able to catch the train.</p>
